## 74th Place at NahamCon EU 22!
Just a short brag: Me and my team participated in the NahamCon EU 22 CTF in December and we ranked 74th out of 1651 teams! This was pretty exciting and I enjoyed it a whole lot! 

Massive thanks to [Cam](https://www.cblanken.dev/) for playing and Dennis from [the Roppers Academy](https://www.roppers.org/) for teaching and mentoring us.
